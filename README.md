# OpenFoodFacts

Project that request data from the OpenFoodFact API, parse and store into a database 
for further use.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure to have Python 3x installed on your computer
Run the following in your command prompt
```
python
```
I used Python 3.8.0 to built this program

### Installing

A step by step that tell you how to get my code up and running :

- Clone my repo

```
git clone https://github.com/Mcflan-7/P5_OpenFoodFacts.git
```

- Set up your virtual environnement (using venv for this example, any will do)

```
python -m venv venv
```
- Activate your virtual environement with
 `source venv/Scripts/activate` on windows 
 `source venv/bin/activate` on MacOS

- Install the requirement with

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Launch the programme 

```
python -m main
```

### Coding style and tools for formating

I try to stick to the -PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code- as most as I can, to format my code I use those tools

```
isort

docformatter

black

flake8
```
