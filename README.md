## Getting Started ðŸš€

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure to have Python 3x installed on your computer
Run the following in your command prompt

```
python
```

I used **Python 3.8.0** to built this program, Python 3.0 to 3.8 will work.

### Installing

A step by step that tell you how to get my code up and running :

- Clone my repo

```
git clone https://github.com/Mcflan-7/P5_OpenFoodFacts.git
```

- Set up your virtual environnement (using venv for this example, any will do)

```
python -m venv venv
```

- Activate your virtual environement with

  ```
  Windows: source venv/Scripts/activate
  MacOS: source venv/bin/activate
  ```

- Install the requirement with

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Create database

```
CREATE DATABASE openfoodfacts CHARACTER SET 'utf8mb4' COLLATE 'utf8mb4_unicode_ci';
```

- Launch installation script

```
python -m install
```

- Launch the programme

```
python -m openfoodfacts
```
